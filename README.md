### ðŸ”’ Computer Security Course Project

This group project was developed as part of our **Computer Security** course. The system is integrated with multiple advanced security features, including:

- Real-time alerts for suspicious activities  
- Intrusion detection system (IDS)  
- DoS (Denial of Service) attack prevention  
- Multi-factor authentication  
- SQL injection protection  
- Data masking for sensitive information  

These implementations collectively ensure strong data security and precise access control throughout the application.
